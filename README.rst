ZAP (the Zurich Atmosphere Purge)
---------------------------------

ZAP is a high precision sky subtraction tool which can be used as complete sky
subtraction solution, or as an enhancement to previously sky-subtracted data.
The method uses PCA to isolate the residual sky subtraction features and remove
them from the observed datacube.

ZAP can be installed simply with:

pip install zap

or into the user path with

pip install --user zap
